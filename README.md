# ðŸš“ Crime Forecasting using Machine Learning

This project focuses on forecasting crime rates using real-world crime data and classification models. It includes exploratory data analysis, model training, and predictive visualizations.

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Classification Report
- Heatmaps & Histograms

## ðŸ§° Libraries & Tools
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Understand trends and patterns in historical crime data
- Classify potential crime categories
- Predict high-risk zones or times
- Visualize patterns by time, type, and location

## ðŸ“„ Output
- Cleaned dataset
- Visual insights
- Trained ML model
- Accuracy and confusion matrix

## ðŸ’» How to Run
1. Clone repo and open `crime_prediction.ipynb`
2. Run all cells
3. Try modifying parameters to improve model accuracy
